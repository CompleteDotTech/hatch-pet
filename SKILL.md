name: hatch-pet
description: Create, import, animate, review and reuse layered 2D casts across scenes, or produce Codex pets and reusable raster sequences. Combine character state packs by anatomy, compile profiles and event recipes, or make process illustrations, product variants, printable frames, pictograms, research stimuli, cursors and craft grids. Uses installed imagegen, versioned cast and clip contracts, deterministic rendering and explicit review. Does not install, publish or certify external integrations implicitly.

# Hatch Pet

Use `profiles/codex-v1.json` for a Codex pet. Its state order, counts, durations, 192×208 cells, 8 columns, transparency rules and package contract are fixed. Existing `examples/*.json` remain supported. For another purpose, use a validated profile or one of the ten [purpose-specific presets](references/additional-uses.md).

For a cast performing in scenes, use `scripts/production.py` and the separate production schema. Read [production contracts](references/production-contracts.md) before constructing characters or clips, [operations](references/production-operations.md) for exact commands, and [rendering](references/production-rendering.md) for compositor, preview and editor handoff behavior. Follow the [production recipe](references/production-pilot.md) for the retained Milo/Luma sources and two-scene demonstration. Keep legacy millisecond timing separate from integer production frames and rational frame rates.

## Choose the source and contract

- **Generate artwork:** read the installed `$imagegen` skill and use it for every production model call. Hatch-pet has no alternate generation backend. Follow its attachment, transparency, output-display and save-path rules. Only an unreferenced base may be text-only. Every image in a claimed handoff must actually be attached, including original references, canonical identity and the layout guide. Preserve explicit constraints on every retry and repair.
- **Import existing artwork:** use `import-source` with an explicit origin and ordered image, strip or frame source. Imports never become imagegen output. Validate and visually review them. See [sources and identity](references/sources-and-identity.md) for the complete import-and-review recipe, reference roles and structured identity specification.
- **Develop/test:** use labeled synthetic fixtures. A fixture receipt tests the gate; it is not production artwork acceptance. Never relabel fixtures as user artwork or model output.

Run `python scripts/hatch.py doctor` before unfamiliar workflows; `capabilities` lists bounded interfaces. Use [workflow](references/workflow.md) for lifecycle commands. Unsupported formats, policies and excessive allocations must fail clearly.

## Select expanded character states

Read [character states](references/character-states.md) for catalog discovery, packs, archetypes, recipes and complete examples. Use `python scripts/hatch.py states list`, `states search curious`, `states show running`, `states packs` and `states archetypes` to inspect definitions and generation requirements. The catalog's `running` remains task processing; directional running uses separate identifiers.

Compile a selected subset before preparing artwork:

```bash
python scripts/hatch.py states compile --selection examples/state-selections/expressive-cat.json --output output/cat-profile.json
python scripts/hatch.py prepare --run-dir output/cat-run --profile output/cat-profile.json --pet-name Miso --reference art/cat.png
```

Read the compilation estimates, substitutions and omissions. Confirm the chosen archetype/capabilities against the actual reference; presets are assumptions. Use explicit `--anatomy-policy substitute` or `filter` only when that behavior is intended. Reconcile required props with `identity.approved_props`. The adjacent `.selection.json` is validated, copied into the run, and retained with review/export evidence. Keep it with the profile. Select new states in a new run; `revise-profile` retains original selection provenance as history.

Treat every catalog entry as a definition, not generated artwork. `states preview` reports available assets and their origin/review status; an ungenerated state has no animation preview. Never build or generate the Complete Character Studio as one atlas. Use bounded subsets, inspect state/frame/memory/call estimates, and retain the existing attempt/concurrency/budget controls. Use `--reduced-motion` at compilation for one expressive still per selected state, or the ordinary per-state still alternatives in browser playback. Expanded profiles are custom exports; they do not extend Codex's fixed nine rows.

## Select and preserve visual style

Use `python scripts/hatch.py styles` to enumerate the versioned visual library, `styles --search WORD` or `--category ID` to narrow it, and `style --style-preset ID` to inspect the full artistic direction and limitations. Add `--json` for agent-readable metadata. Read [the style catalog](references/style-catalog.md) for every ID, category quick starts, composition rules and contributor instructions; do not load the entire catalog into a generation prompt.

Select a stable ID or declared alias with the existing `--style-preset`. Add explicit refinements with `--style-notes` and zero to four separate themes with repeated `--style-modifier`; enumerate those with `style-modifiers`. Keep themes, treatments and aliases separate from the technique count. Preserve the original nine presets and existing profile semantics.

Resolve the style once during preparation. Keep `pet_request.json.resolved_style`, its version/hash and exact contract unchanged across canonical-base generation, rows, retries, repair, resume and archive restoration. Every profile receives the complete selected instructions. Explicit requirements/avoidances, approved references/identity and the profile contract take precedence. For an imported base, preserve its approved existing rendering; do not restyle it or label it generated because a preset was requested. For reference-guided `auto`, lock the exact rendering through canonical visual review.

Read compatibility warnings before generation. Adapt glass, light effects, fibers, fine marks and decorative techniques into a readable isolated silhouette. Resolve unsupported chroma combinations using alpha or a deliberate supported adaptation before proceeding. New runs use the style's recommended extraction fallback; explicit profile filters win. Use nearest for crisp grids and filtered edges for continuous media, preserving fixed geometry. Review actual-size consistency and edge quality; record notes for every current warning. Automated catalog tests do not establish subjective imagegen artwork quality.

## Execute and preserve evidence

1. **Prepare** a new run with profile, concept, style, user constraints, structured identity and required references. Keep inferred brand guidance separate, attributed and subordinate to explicit requirements. Report unresolved conflicts. Structured identity helps inspection; it does not prove visual consistency.
2. **Acquire the base** through a claimed imagegen handoff or explicit import. Inspect canonical identity, transparency and color analysis, then record `base-review` before states.
3. **Acquire each state.** Claim only ready jobs. Keep the existing claim/token until its output is ingested or failure is recorded. Optional mirroring is not a generation dependency. Derive only where the profile permits it and explicit approval covers asymmetries, markings, props and direction; never when identity forbids mirroring.
4. **Extract and validate.** Preserve the conservative default. Use exact, hash-bound annotations for legitimate disconnected components or non-strip layouts; never disable validation globally. Keep one shared viewport and scale, including intended jump displacement. Choose validated resampling for the artwork. See [extraction and review](references/extraction-and-review.md) for diagnostics and calibration.
5. **Review actual artifacts.** Build `review-ui`, inspect references, sources, extracted frames and actual-size timed playback on multiple backgrounds. Record identity, action, direction, loop, extraction and reduced-motion verdicts plus warning-specific notes. Submit the exact bound receipt. A change to covered artifacts requires fresh review; numerical QA cannot supply a semantic verdict.
6. **Export/package.** An evaluation export may be unreviewed and must say so. Packaging requires current deterministic validation and passing visual review. Report source origin, fixture status, review status and exact output locations separately from integration status.

## Produce and reuse a cast

1. **Select identities and versions.** Keep one portable cast shared by project scenes. Record dimensions, relative scale, directional restrictions, costumes, approved differences, source permissions/attribution and view evidence. Distinguish approved design references from authored, reviewed animation components. Preserve earlier versions when importing or adopting changed components.
2. **Construct measured parts.** Declare parent hierarchy, pivots, attachment anchors, draw order, masks, alpha, common drawing viewports and viewpoint compatibility. Retain exact source and crop/registration provenance. Inspect the assembled character; successful extraction or segmentation does not establish anatomy or artistic quality.
3. **Plan the shot.** Declare explicit and inferred choices separately. Run `coverage` before generation. Resolve missing assets, incompatible combinations and unreviewed clips across independent dimensions; do not generate every combination. Bind acquisition runs to the exact required coverage before further claims. Use the existing hatch claim, failure and repair lifecycle with bounded calls.
4. **Author performance.** Use reusable clips with entry/exit poses, displacement, contact markers, events and interruption rules. Use explicit transition drawings or clips when bounded numeric interpolation is unsuitable. Keep a planted contact stable in world coordinates and retain intentional root motion and fixed character scale. Never conceal a mismatch by fitting each performance frame independently.
5. **Layer acting and interaction.** Edit body, face, gaze and mouth tracks independently where the construction supports them. Retain supplied audio or actual local TTS provenance and inspectable dialogue cues. Require one prop owner, explicit attachments and synchronized handoff markers. Check actual hand/object positions; neither aligned timing nor coincident anchors proves convincing acting.
6. **Render and inspect.** Render PNG/PCM masters, validate exact frame/sample duration, then inspect representative frames, transitions, contact moments, dialogue and complete playback. Use the local preview for scrub/step, layer visibility and comparisons. Browser timing is a preview; offline masters are authoritative. Use the documented Krita PNG/WAV/OpenRaster handoff for drawing edits, and label exported files, adapter roundtrip and real application exercise separately.
7. **Record scoped decisions.** Use `review-template`, fill actual reviewer identity, verdicts and inspected evidence, then `review`. Review construction, motion, face/dialogue, contacts, composition, continuity, AV timing and final artifacts separately. Bind final reviews to the completed shot manifest and actual rendered frames. Preserve review history; metrics and synthetic receipts cannot stand in for production artwork review.
8. **Reuse and repair selectively.** Add another scene selecting the same character/clip versions. Use `snapshot`, `impact`, `coverage` and `reviews` to explain changed or stale work; rerender only affected pixels and re-review affected dimensions. Keep exact provenance and required coverage through retries. Archive/restore to a new directory and inspect restoration diagnostics before using cached approvals.

Start a model-free regression project with `python scripts/production_regression_demo.py --output-dir NEW_DIR --movie`. Reproduce retained production sources with the commands in the production recipe. These are different evidence classes; never promote fixture success into production-art acceptance. Use `python scripts/production.py COMMAND --help` for required flags. `--output NEW.json` writes the full report there and prints only its path.

## Recovery and operational scope

`status` and `resume` reconcile existing claims and explain stale inputs; they never start duplicate model calls. Configure attempt, concurrency and call limits; optional budgets use explicit user estimates, not invented prices. Deterministic calibration changes reuse generation. Use `revise-profile` for controlled playback/extraction/export revisions. See [portability and operations](references/portability-and-operations.md) for migrations, verified archives and restoration.

Installation is a separate, explicitly requested action with verified backups and rollback. Package creation, exported adapters, local browser exercises, installation and live integration are different outcomes. Do not claim an external consumer was exercised without evidence. No live installation, publishing or deployment is implied. Never shut down or terminate WSL.

When authorized to delegate, one worker may own one existing generation claim or visual review; keep a single manifest owner. Handoffs retain token, prompt, image roles/hashes, identity and failure history. Workers follow imagegen's required output behavior and return the selected original source plus a QA note. Without delegation, execute sequentially.
